## Use Your Own Email API

This project uses a **custom-built backend** deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which utilizes **Nodemailer** for email functionality.

If you'd like to use your own API instance:

1. Visit the backend repo: [https://github.com/KareemEhab/email-sender](https://github.com/KareemEhab/email-sender)
2. Follow the instructions in its `README.md` to:
   - Set up the email server
   - Configure a Gmail to be used to send emails
   - Deploy the API on Vercel or your preferred platform
3. Once deployed, update the frontend file:
   - Open `/src/utils/sendEmail.ts`
   - Replace the fetch URL with your deployed API endpoint:
     ```ts
     return await fetch("https://your-vercel-deployment.vercel.app/send", {
       method: "POST",
       headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         name,
         email,
         subject,
         message,
         receiver_email,
       }),
